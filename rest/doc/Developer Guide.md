# Weaver-Rest Developer Guide

Weaver-Rest is a basic web server for use in creating web services.  Weaver-Rest is designed to be embedded into your application and run standalone, which makes it really easy to develop, test, and deploy.  Weaver-Rest takes care of most of the boilerplate for you, leaving you primarily with the task of implementing your web service logic.

Where to go from here:
* I've heard enough - I just want to [Get Started](Getting Started.md).
* I'd like to see the more detailed Developer Documentation (not done yet).
