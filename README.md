#Weaver

Weaver is a collection of embeddable, Netty-based web servers that can be used to quickly create web services.  Weaver allows you to build functioning embedded web servers in only a few lines of code so you can quickly focus on your business logic.

Weaver includes:

* Weaver-REST - A basic REST web server with JAX-RS 2.0 support
* Weaver-SIP - A basic SIP server, using the same metaphor as Weaver-REST, with custom annotations specific to SIP
* Weaver-XMPP - A basic XMPP server, using the same metaphor as Weaver-REST, with custom annotations specific to XMPP

Weaver is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use in anything real.
