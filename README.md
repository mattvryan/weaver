#Weaver

Weaver is a collection of embeddable, Netty-based web servers that can be used to quickly create web services.  Weaver allows you to build functioning embedded web servers in only a few lines of code so you can quickly focus on your business logic.

Weaver includes:

* Weaver-HTTP - A basic HTTP 1.1 web server optimized for web services
* [Weaver-REST](rest/doc/Developer Guide.md) - A basic REST web server with JAX-RS 2.0 support
* Weaver-??? - Who knows?

Weaver is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use in anything real.
